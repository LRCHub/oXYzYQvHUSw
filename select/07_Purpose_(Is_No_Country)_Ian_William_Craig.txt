There is an old song
Red as red as red
A painting that pulls as it dries
Spent all of Sunday lost in the woods
But purpose is no country you can find
Purpose is no country you can find

An event lacking nothing
Flat as flat as flat
A dream between the softness and the wires
Stretching the map until it turns into land
But purpose is no country you can find
Purpose is no country you can find

You are revealed
You are revealed again
You are a constant surprise
Longing for roots and a steady hand
But purpose is no country you can find
Purpose is no country you can find

There is an old song
Red as red as red
Drifting to void on all sides
Spent all of Sunday lost in the woods
But purpose is no country you can find
Purpose is no country you can find
